## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. It is a list of functions that allow to set and get the value of the matrix
##and the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    ## Set the value of the matrix
    ## Get the value of the matrix
    ## Set the value of the matrix inverse
    ## Get the value of the matrix inverse
}


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
